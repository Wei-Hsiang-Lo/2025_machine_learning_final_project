# Fully Automated Physics Aware Chip Design
**Course**: Machine Learning \
**Student**: 314652021 羅瑋翔 

## ⚡️Overview
$\qquad$ This project implements a simple version of fully automated chip design. By implementing the model, we can discover the heat source distribution of the chip via supervised-learning. Then we can problaly find the optimal layout of the chip design. And this model obeys the energy conservation law.
